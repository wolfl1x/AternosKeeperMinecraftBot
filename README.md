# Minecraft Aternos Keeper Bot

A Node.js bot that keeps your Minecraft server on Aternos (free hosting) active 24/7 by simulating player activity.

## Features

- üéÆ Performs random player activities (jumping, moving, looking around)
- üîÑ Auto-reconnects when disconnected
- ‚ö° Lightweight and efficient
- üõ†Ô∏è Easy to configure

## How It Works

Aternos free servers automatically shut down when no players are online. This bot connects to your server and performs random activities to simulate a real player, preventing the server from going offline.

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minecraft-aternos-keeper.git

    Edit bot.js and update the server configuration:
